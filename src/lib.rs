//! Write your own tests and benchmarks that look and behave like built-in tests!
//!
//! This is a simple and small test harness that mimics the original `libtest`
//! (used by `cargo test`/`rustc --test`). That means: all output looks pretty
//! much like `cargo test` and most CLI arguments are understood and used. With
//! that plumbing work out of the way, your test runner can focus on the actual
//! testing.
//!
//! For a small real world example, see [`examples/tidy.rs`][1].
//!
//! [1]: https://github.com/LukasKalbertodt/libtest-mimic/blob/master/examples/tidy.rs
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! To use this, you most likely want to add a manual `[[test]]` section to
//! `Cargo.toml` and set `harness = false`. For example:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [[test]]
//! name = "mytest"
//! path = "tests/mytest.rs"
//! harness = false
//! ```
//!
//! And in `tests/mytest.rs` you would call [`run`] in the `main` function:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use libtest_mimic::{Arguments, Trial};
//!
//!
//! // Parse command line arguments
//! let args = Arguments::from_args();
//!
//! // Create a list of tests and/or benchmarks (in this case: two dummy tests).
//! let tests = vec![
//!     Trial::test("succeeding_test", move || Ok(())),
//!     Trial::test("failing_test", move || Err("Woops".into())),
//! ];
//!
//! // Run all tests and exit the application appropriatly.
//! libtest_mimic::run(&args, tests).exit();
//! ```
//!
//! Instead of returning `Ok` or `Err` directly, you want to actually perform
//! your tests, of course. See [`Trial::test`] for more information on how to
//! define a test. You can of course list all your tests manually. But in many
//! cases it is useful to generate one test per file in a directory, for
//! example.
//!
//! You can then run `cargo test --test mytest` to run it. To see the CLI
//! arguments supported by this crate, run `cargo test --test mytest -- -h`.
//!
//!
//! # Known limitations and differences to the official test harness
//!
//! `libtest-mimic` works on a best-effort basis: it tries to be as close to
//! `libtest` as possible, but there are differences for a variety of reasons.
//! For example, some rarely used features might not be implemented, some
//! features are extremely difficult to implement, and removing minor,
//! unimportant differences is just not worth the hassle.
//!
//! Some of the notable differences:
//!
//! - Output capture and `--nocapture`: simply not supported. The official
//!   `libtest` uses internal `std` functions to temporarily redirect output.
//!   `libtest-mimic` cannot use those. See [this issue][capture] for more
//!   information.
//! - `--format=json|junit`
//!
