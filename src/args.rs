/// This type represents everything the user can specify via CLI args. The main
/// method is [`from_args`][Arguments::from_args] which reads the global
/// `std::env::args()` and parses them into this type.
///
/// The CLI is very similar to the one from the native test harness. However,
/// there are minor differences:
/// - Most notable: the `--help` message is slightly different. This comes from
///   the fact that this crate (right now) uses structopt (which uses `clap`)
///   while the original `libtest` uses `docopt`.
/// - `--skip` only accepts one value per occurence (but can occur multiple
///   times). This solves ambiguity with the `filter` value at the very end.
///   Consider "`--skip foo bar`": should this be parsed as `skip: vec!["foo",
///   "bar"], filter: None` or `skip: vec!["foo"], filter: Some("bar")`? Here,
///   it's clearly the latter version. If you need multiple values for `skip`,
///   do it like this: `--skip foo --skip bar`.
/// - `--bench` and `--test` cannot be both set at the same time. It doesn't
///   make sense, but it's allowed in `libtest` for some reason.
///
/// **Note**: just because all CLI args can be parsed, doesn't mean that they
/// are all automatically used. Check [`run_tests`][::run_tests] for information on which
/// arguments are automatically used and require special care.
