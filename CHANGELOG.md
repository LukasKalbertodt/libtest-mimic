## [0.5.0] - 2022-08-13

Most parts of this library have been rewritten and the API has changed a lot.
You might be better of just reading the new docs instead of this change log.
I do think the new API is better in many regards.
Apart from an improved API, changes that motivated the rewrite are marked with ⭐.

### Changed
- **Breaking**: bump MSRV to 1.58
- **Breaking**: Rename `Test` to `Trial`
- **Breaking**: Rename `run_tests` to `run`
- ⭐ **Breaking**: Make every `Trial` have a runner function instead of `data` + a
  global runner function. Thus, the third parameter of `run` is no more. I think
  this model is more intuitive.
- **Breaking**: Add `Trial::{test, bench}` constructor functions, use builder
  pattern, and make fields private.
- **Breaking**: rename `Args::num_threads` to `test_threads`
- **Breaking**: make fields of `Conclusion` public and remove getter methods
- **Breaking**: remove `RunnerEvent`. This should not have been public.
- ⭐ Tests are now run in main thread when `--test-threads=1` is specified
- ⭐ Reduce number of indirect dependencies considerably
- Fix `rust-version` field in `Cargo.toml` (thanks @hellow554)
- Fix `--ignored` behavior
- Fix some CLI error messages

### Added
- ⭐Panics in test runners are caught and treated as failure
- ⭐ Lots of integration tests (should make any future development of this library way easier)
- Add `must_use` message for `Conclusion`
- Print total execution time at the end of the run
- Allow benchmarks to run in test mode
- `--include-ignored`

### Removed
- **Breaking**: remove unsupported CLI options. They were ignored anyway, but
  the CLI would accept them.


## [0.4.1] - 2022-06-07

- Add `rust = "1.56"` to `Cargo.toml`, stating the existing MSRV.

## [0.4.0] - 2022-05-13
- **Breaking**: Update to Rust 2021, bumping MSRV to 1.56
- Fix `--list --ignored` behavior


## [0.3.0] - 2020-06-28
